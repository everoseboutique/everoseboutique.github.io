    <h2>Meet the Founder</h2>

    <p style="font-size:18px;">
      Hi, my name is <strong>Cruz Keller</strong>, and I am the founder of Everose.
    </p>

    <p>
      I was born in New Jersey and New York, and I’ve always been inspired by creativity,
      beauty, and self-expression. I love to dance, spend time with my family, and dream up new ideas.
    </p>

    <p>
      Everose was created from my love for elegance, softness, and confidence. I wanted to build a
      fragrance brand that feels emotional, beautiful, and meaningful — something that people can
      connect memories and feelings to.
    </p>

    <p>
      Every Everose scent is inspired by a season, a mood, and a moment. This brand is not just about
      perfume, but about becoming your most confident and graceful self.
    </p>

    <p style="margin-top:30px;">
      <strong>Founded by Cruz Elizabeth Keller</strong>
